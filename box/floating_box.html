      <p>Ferrari S.p.A. is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello. Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari
         (1898-1988), the company built its first car in 1940, adopted its current name in 1945, and began to produce
         its current line of road cars in 1947. Ferrari became a public company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a
         subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016. The
         company currently offers a large model range which includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many
         early Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among the most expensive cars ever sold at auction.</p>
